# Django tutorial app

<p>This application was created solely by me following instructions from Django's library tutorial which can be found here: [Getting started | Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/)</p>

## Project description
> Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic poll application.
> It’ll consist of two parts:
> - A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
> - An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
